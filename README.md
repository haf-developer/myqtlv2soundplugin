This is my personal project for learning test driven development and
maintaining software project.

Note how to get this compiled.
Before building any executable project like testsoundlib or soundQtGUIAutoTest translation files needs to be realeased.
That requires starting Qt Linguist and openin at least one .ts file from uiforms project. Those are located under
other files folder. Then choosing release at the file menu. This will generate at least one .qm file which is needed
for building something executable.

Using lrelease external tool from Qt creator doesn't work because soundlv2 subdirs project doesn't have any TRANSLATIONS content.
